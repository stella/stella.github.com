I just added support for the [Geckoboard](http://geckoboard.com/) widget to the new site. You can get the link on the host page under the "Data" tab.

## Add Widget ##

* Click "Add Widget" on your Geckoboard Dashboard
* Select "Custom Charts"
* Choose the "Geck-o-meter" widget

## Configure Widget ##

* Paste in the link from the first step into the "URL Data Feed" field.
* Set the feed format to JSON.
* Click Save and you're done.

If you'd like to see support for other widgets, [let me know](https://www.blamestella.com/#feedback).
