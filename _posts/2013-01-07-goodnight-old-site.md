I just turned off old.blamestella.com. After two, loyal years of service, the original blamestella.com has been decommissioned. It had it's bumps and scrapes but that app ran like a rock.

### A few stats
<pre>
===========================================================
        LEDGER OF CUSTOMER STATISTICS 2010-2012**
===========================================================

  Checkups performed ........................     300,000
  Performance monitoring tests .............. 150,000,000
  Incidents detected ........................      60,000

  Overall customer availability .............      99.96%

             ** since launch (August 2010)
===========================================================
</pre>

The old version pulled about 5GB per day. The current version, which now loads the entire page thanks to [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), pulls close to 35GB/day. Quite a step up!

### Fare thee well
