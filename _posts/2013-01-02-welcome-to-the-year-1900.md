title: Welcome to the year 1900

It's been a long-time coming but the new version of [Stella](https://www.blamestella.com/) is live. I ran the migration on New Year's Eve which is perfect timing if you know Morton and Tucker (the characters behind the brand). For them, it's 1900 and what better way to ring in the new century!

So what's changed. Well, *just about everything*. A new codebase (built around [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)), a new UI (using [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)), and a whole new lease on life. For those early customers who sent in feature requests and even some bugs, this release is for you. I still have a few items on that TODO list but now that this release is out, I can finally tackle them. These include:

* Multiple notification contacts
* Support for POST requests
* SMS delivery issues in certain parts of Europe
* *I could go on...*

But take a look at the difference:

### Old homepage vs New homepage

The homepage has been tighten up. I brought all the important stuff above the fold and removed the news conversations (which you can't see in the screencap but you can tell they took up a lot of room).

### Old dashboard vs New dashboard

Thanks to PhantomJS (headless webkit), we can now take screenshots. It's a much more intuitive way to natigate your list of sites.

## What's Next

This release is a new beginning for BlameStella.com. There's still tonnes to do, from ironing out the rough edges to implementing new innovative features. The [old site](https://old.blamestella.com/) is still running for the time being but I'll be sunsetting it soon.

And as you can see this blog is new too. I'm going to write more about the technology behind the service as well as my experiences as a founder. It's something I've wanted to do for a long, long time and now I'm finally doing it. Some posts I'm working on:

* The things that slowed me down
* Who are Morton &amp; Tucker and why do I care?
* My thoughts on startup accelerators (we went through one)

I also have another announcement lined up for this week. Stay tuned!
