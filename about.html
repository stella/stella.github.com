      <h3>About BlameStella</h3>
      <p>BlameStella.com is a web monitoring service built with
         <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>,

      <p>
        I built <a href="https://www.blamestella.com/">Stella</a> to scratch an itch. That is, a web monitoring service that met my needs as a web developer. I've worked on sites large and small and I'm putting everything I learned into building great software for others.
      </p>

      <p>
        I launched the service in 2010 and relaunched on January 1st, 2013. I've had a lot of fun and learned a lot along the way. I'm using this blog to write about my experiences running the company and the technology behind it.
